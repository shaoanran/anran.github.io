### Who am I?
  I am second-year student in **Mailman School of Public Health**, studying Epidemiology certificated in Applied Biostatistics.  I was a research assistant investigating the association between the use of iron supplement and birth weight in Cameroon.  Now, I am working on my thesis about how Alternative Health Eating Pattern effect the breast cancer risk among high-risk population, and how the association is impacted by other potential factors such as breast cancer subtypes and family history. 
    
  I am taking **Data Science** recently to learn how to build my own website with R.
